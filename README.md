# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

[Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://streamlen.github.io/sortingAlgorithmVisualizer/)

## Introduction

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application that helps users understand the inner workings of various sorting algorithms. This project visualizes sorting algorithms step-by-step, making it easier to comprehend how these algorithms operate.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms in action with real-time visual feedback.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports a variety of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.
- **User Controls**: Adjust the speed of the visualization and the size of the data set to be sorted.

## Technologies Used

- ** JavaScript**: The core functionality and logic of the sorting algorithms.
- ** HTML**: The structure of the web application.
- ** CSS**: Styling and layout of the application.
